# Elephanator (V1.0.0)

Elephanator is a software tool designed for the development process of applications that require database deployment. It enables developers to effortlessly deploy a system’s database and make updates as changes occur, making it particularly useful in scenarios where the database may undergo frequent modifications.

Additionally, Elephanator is compatible with the production server, allowing developers to apply patches when they are committed to a master (production) branch using a tool like GitHub Actions.

## Commands

```
python dbtool.py --init --connectionstring "<connection string>"
```
_**Note:** This command must be executed before you use the software_

**Add a database patch.**
```

```
